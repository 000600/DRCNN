# DRCNN
A CNN that classifies whether or not one has diabetic retinopathy based on an image of their retinas.

## The Model
I found the neural network had consistent test and validation accuracies of around 94% and an AUC of around 98% after I tuned various hyperparameters, but I am sure higher accuracies are possible.

## The Dataset

## Libraries
These neural networks and XGBoost Regressor were created with the help of the Tensorflow library.
